If you’d like to act on the most recent notification, you can swipe up and into it. If you’d like to simply unlock your phone, you can do that by swiping down. Designed to be light on resources, battery and frustration, AcDisplay is the perfect companion for you.\r\n\r\n**[Join app's community on Google Play](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102085470313050914854)**\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.activedisplay\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Get AcDisplay on Google Play\" vspace=\"20\"\r\n       src=\"https://github.com/AChep/AcDisplay/raw/master/art/google_play.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
